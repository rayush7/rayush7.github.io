I am a $$3^{rd}$$ year doctoral student in computer vision and deep learning at [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Alan F. Smeaton](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~asmeaton/) and [Prof. Noel O'Connor](https://www.insight-centre.org/our-team/prof-noel-oconnor/). My research interests include learning robust and fine-grained video representations. Recently I have developed an interesting in efficient computational methods for video understanding.

Prior to this, I was a graduate student at [Ecole CentraleSupelec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), Paris pursuing M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence. I completed my master's research Internship at [Centre for Robotics](https://www.caor.minesparis.psl.eu/), [MINES ParisTech](https://mines-paristech.eu/).  

**Research interests:** Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Video Understanding, Multi-modal Learning: Vision + Language <br>

**Currently I am actively looking for Research Internships in the field of video understanding.**
